Introduced the REST API
- Get: get a post
- Post: create a post
- Put: update a post
- Delete: delete a post


- Nodemon: so we don't have to update the get request manually: get the latest output without killing the terminal (just update local host)

- Endpoint (the app.post/get/put/delete, followed with the URL)
- a combination of URL + HTTP method that lets 
- the client interact with a specific resource

-REMEMBER TO ADD ".js" in tjhe import statement
